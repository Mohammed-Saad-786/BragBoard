### 🚀 Building a Culture of Recognition Through Technology

A modern full-stack employee engagement platform that enables organizations to celebrate achievements, recognize contributions, and strengthen workplace culture through peer-to-peer appreciation.

</div>

---

## 📖 Overview

BragBoard is a workplace recognition platform designed to encourage positive employee engagement through peer-to-peer appreciation.

Employees can create shoutouts, recognize colleagues, interact through comments and reactions, and contribute to a culture of recognition and motivation within their organization.

The platform is built using modern technologies including React, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, and JWT Authentication.

---

## 🏢 Business Problem

In modern workplaces, employee contributions and achievements often go unnoticed due to busy schedules, distributed teams, and limited opportunities for recognition.

Organizations commonly face the following challenges:

- Lack of a centralized platform for employee recognition
- Employee achievements are often overlooked or underappreciated
- Reduced employee engagement and workplace morale
- Limited peer-to-peer appreciation and collaboration
- Difficulty tracking recognition trends and team contributions
- Lack of visibility into employees making a positive impact

As a result, employees may feel less motivated, less connected to their teams, and less valued within the organization, ultimately affecting productivity, retention, and workplace culture.

---

## 💡 Solution

BragBoard provides a centralized peer-recognition platform that enables employees to appreciate and celebrate each other's contributions.

The platform empowers organizations by:

- Creating a culture of appreciation and recognition
- Increasing employee engagement and morale
- Providing visibility into employee achievements
- Encouraging collaboration across teams and departments
- Enabling administrators to monitor engagement trends and recognition metrics
- Building a more connected and motivated workforce

Through shoutouts, reactions, comments, and analytics, BragBoard transforms recognition into a measurable and impactful part of workplace culture.
